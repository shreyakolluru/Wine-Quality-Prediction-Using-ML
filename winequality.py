"""From the above correlation plot for the given dataset for wine quality prediction, we can easily see which items are related strongly with each other and which items are related weekly with each other. For Example,

# **The strongly correlated items are :**
1.fixed acidity and citric acid. 2.free sulphur dioxide and total sulphor dioxide. 3.fixed acidity and density. 4. alcohol and quality.

so, from above points there is a clear inference that alcohol is the most important characteristic to determine the quality of wine.

# **The weekly correlated items are :**
1.citric acid and volatile acidity. 2.fixed acidity and ph. 3.density and alcohol.

These are some relations which do not depend on each other at all.
